# Policies on late assignments / makeup work

I do not accept late assignments, nor do I provide makeup assignments. You are responsible for your own Internet connection when working remotely. Work ahead if you know you are going to have conflicts or time constraints. Please schedule yourself accordingly.

<br>

# Evaluation methods

I calculate an overall score based on your performance on homework assignments, labs, and assessments. Assessments are scheduled with specific due dates/times. The following weights are applied to determine your course grade:

| **Metric** | **Weight** |
|:-------------------|:-------------------|
|    Programming assignments	  |    15% |
|    Labs  |    15% |
|    Quizzes  |    10%  |
|    Midterm Exam  |    30%  |
|    Final Exam  |    30%  |

Additionally, to pass the course with a grade of C or better, you must (1) **maintain a lab score of 70% or better** and (2) **sit for all exams.**

## How grades are determined

I use the following grading scale applied to your overall score.

| **Letter** | **Overall** |
|:-------------------|:-------------------|
|    A	  |    100 to 94% |
|    A-  |    < 94 to 90% |
|    B+  |    < 90 to 87%  |
|    B   |    < 87 to 84%  |
|    B-  |    < 84 to 80%  |
|    C+  |    < 80 to 77%  |
|    C  |    < 77 to 70%  |
|    D+  |    < 70 to 67%  |
|    D  |    < 67 to 64%  |
|    D-  |    < 64 to 61%  |
|    F  |    < 61 to 0%  |

> ### Letter grades shown in Canvas are approximations. I reserve the right to adjust your final grade up/down based on your attendance, participation, and effort.

<p>You may withdraw from the course without academic penalty if you do so by the date published in the academic calendar. Enrollment in the course will appear on your college record, and you will receive a "W" for the class. You should not stop attending the class without officially withdrawing in person or online. Failure to properly withdraw from the class may result in the assignment of an "F" grade to your permanent record.</p>

<br>

# Important Note
At the end of the first week of classes, all teaching faculty MUST verify ACTIVE student participation. Any student who doesn't participate during this time will be administratively dropped from this course.
Failure to participate in class during the first week of the semester will result in an administrative withdrawal.

<br>

# Attendance Policy

Attendance and participation are mandatory.
I expect you to be ready at the beginning of the meeting time, heretofore referred to as class time. I do not record attendance at the beginning of each class but our scheduled quiz keeps track of that. Please notify me in advance if you will be late or absent (*things happen, I just want to make sure you don't fall behind as we only meet once per week*).

While not a specific component of your overall score, I use attendance and participation statistics when computing final letter grades. You are responsible for all topics presented in class or posted/discussed in Canvas and our Discord server.

## Additional information unique to the class or instructor
1. We are all adults. You can expect me to treat you with courtesy and respect, and I expect the same from you when interacting with your classmates or me.
2. I like to encourage a casual and friendly atmosphere. In that spirit, please call me Miguel (Mr. Castillo is my dad).

# Academic integrity

You are expected to complete your own work in this class. Cheating on exams or lab exercises is not fair to students who are studying honestly. Cheating is also subject to penalties, which can include getting a zero for the assignment or failing the course. The full list of possible penalties is listed in the CSN Student Academic Integrity Policy. Please make yourself familiar with this policy ([https://at.csn.edu/documents/student-academic-integrity-policy](https://at.csn.edu/documents/student-academic-integrity-policy)).

## Stay out of trouble by following these rules:
### **Rule 1: You must not look at solutions or program codes that are not your own.**
<p> It is an act of plagiarism to submit work that is copied or derived from the work of others and submitted as your own. For example, using a solution from the Internet or a solution from another student (past or present) or some other source, in part or in whole, that is not your own work is a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy. Many infractions I see make use of solution code found online. The best way to steer clear of this possibility is not to search for online solutions to the programming assignments. Moreover, looking at someone else's solution code in order to determine how to solve the problem yourself is also an infraction of the Academic Integrity Policy. In essence, you should not be looking at someone else's code in order to solve the problems in this class. This is not an appropriate way to "check your work," "get a hint," or "see alternative approaches." </p>

### **Rule 2: You must not share your solution code with other students.**
<p> In particular, you should not ask anyone to give you a copy of their code or, conversely, give your code to another student who asks you for it. Similarly, you should not discuss your algorithmic strategies to such an extent that you and your collaborators end up turning in the same code. Moreover, you are expected to take reasonable measures to maintain the privacy of your solutions. For example, you should not leave copies of your work on public computers nor post your solution code on websites. </p>

### **Rule 3: You must indicate on your submission any assistance you received.**
If you received aid while producing your solution, you should indicate from whom you got help and what help you received. A proper citation should specifically identify the source (e.g., person's name, book title, website URL, etc.) and a clear indication of how this assistance influenced your work (be as specific as possible). For example, you might write "I discussed the approach used for sorting numbers in the ``sort\_numbers`` function with TA Mary Smith." If you make use of such assistance without giving proper credit, you may be guilty of plagiarism.

It is also important to make sure that the assistance you receive consists of general advice that does not cross the boundary into having someone else write the actual code or show you their code. It is fine to discuss ideas and strategies, but you should be careful to write your programs on your own, as indicated in Rules 1 and 2.

I have no desire to create a climate in which students feel as if they are under suspicion. The entire point of the Academic Integrity Policy is that we all benefit from working in an atmosphere of mutual trust. Students who deliberately take advantage of that trust, however, poison that atmosphere for everyone. I only ask that you be up front and transparent. If you use a Web resource**, just cite the exact source(s). This becomes part of the formal documentation for your program and a ready reference for yourself in the future:

```c++
/// The mathematical constant PI with 15 digits.
/// @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi
const double PI = 3.14159265358979;
```

### **Rule 4: Beware of using Artificial Intelligence Resources**
I am aware of A.I tools such as, but not limited to, ChatGPT. Please refrain from using A.I. tools to complete assignments and to assist on quizzes or exams. My main objective is to prepare students for fruitful careers within the field of computer science. Although A.I. has a place and use, while in the process of learning you should only use it as a reference, not as a leader to write code for you. 

Just be transparent, please. Sneaky behavior destroys trust really quickly.

## Penalties

| **Offense** | **Penalty**|
|:------------|:------------------------------------------------|
| **First**  | You will receive a zero on the assignment, and I will reduce your final course grade by one full letter grade (e.g., if you would have otherwise earned a B+, I will assign a C+ instead). <br> |
| **Second**    | You will receive a failing grade for the course. The class cannot be dropped to avoid the failing grade. |

This prohibition on discrimination extends to pregnancy and related conditions—including childbirth, lactation, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery therefrom—as well as to parental and family status. If you are pregnant or have a pregnancy-related condition, and you are in need of accommodation because of your pregnancy or pregnancy-related condition, you must contact Dr. Armen Asherian, Title IX Coordinator, at titleixcoordinator@csn.edu or 702-651-7481, or the Disability Resource Center at 702-651-5644 for West Charleston, 702-651-3795 for Henderson, and 702-651-4045 for North Las Vegas to explore reasonable accommodation.

# Printing @ CSN
Printing in CSN classrooms, computer labs and libraries falls under Print Wise. Print Wise provides each CSN student with a $10 credit toward printing at the start of each semester, which will provide for up to 200 black and white copies at 5¢ a page, or 40 color copies at 25¢ a page. After that, you ma  y put money into your account online or at the CSN Cashier’s Office to purchase additional prints at the same rate. It is your responsibility to maintain your printing accounts to cover printing expenses during each semester. More information about the Print Wise system may be found at the [Printwise Information](https://www.csn.edu/printwise).
